## ü™Ñ Simple, Integrated, End-to-End Data Analysis Operations

Vantii is a data analysis framework designed for data analysts aiming to standardize and productionize their analytical and machine learning workflows. It simplifies sharing and automating your data insights through a REST service within your organization.

By seamlessly connecting the UI and backend, Vantii allows you to interact with your data, such as a spreadsheet, in a conversational format. Modify the required parts of your dataset through a human-in-the-loop approach powered by Vantii.

Once your analysis is complete, Vantii generates a detailed prompt based on your conversation. This prompt encapsulates all the necessary requirements to automatically create a REST service. You can easily share this endpoint with your team and organization. Vantii takes care of all backend automation and the creation of the REST service. All you need to do is click the Create button, and Vantii will handle the deployment via Docker Compose. In future versions, provisioning will be seamlessly integrated with Kubernetes (K8s).
